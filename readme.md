Damn it!

Firstly, i lost my chinese input method and my english is not pretty good, but i still want to  *fxck* the man who does not use 'utf8'!  
it waste me more than 4 hours to know the url is encoded by 'gbk' instead of 'utf8'! Damn it!  
At first, i can not acess the url, i guess that i do not have cookies or not set up the correct headers, then i try change the headers,but it doesn't work,
i always got the 404 error. It took me 1 hour to fight with the headers.  
Later, I realize that the url encoding is wrong! And then , i spent 3 hours to find out we should use 'gbk' and  how to turn to the correct url!
Damn it !  
But what really make me crazy is that some url still do not work!  
It cost me another 2 hours to find out some url is not encoded by 'gbk',just by the friendly utf8!!  
fxxx! !!!

there is a saying:

> One day i have a blade, die out the gbker!
